# Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based approach to detect plant diseases from images of leaves. The model is trained to classify images into three categories: Healthy, Powdery, and Rust.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images of healthy and diseased leaves. The dataset is split into three parts: Training, Validation, and Testing. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset).

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Flask
- PIL (Pillow)
- matplotlib

## Model File
To get the `model.h5` file, you can run the provided `.ipynb` file to train the model, or you can download it directly from Google Drive using the following link: [model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cWMs4X4tuyt7o-39x3TjnbwZh6rYjRBw/view?usp=drive_link).

## Usage

1. clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/navadeep15/CodeClauseInternship_PlantDiseaseDetection
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. To start the Flask server:
```
